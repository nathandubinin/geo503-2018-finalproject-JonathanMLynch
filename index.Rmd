> I know words.  I have the best words.  ~ Donald Trump

# Materials and methods

Narrative and most code will go here.  Describe what you are doing and show how to do it (with code).

Plan for this project:

1. Create a map of Erie County
2. Add the Hazardous Materials spreadsheet
3. Add the ability to select a location on the map
4. After selecting a location, choose hazardous material
5. This places a polygon of area that needs to be evacuated

```{r}
library(leaflet)

map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-78.798, lat=42.900) %>%
  fitBounds(-79.1, 42.5, -78.5, 43.1)
map  # Print the map
```



# Results

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

# Conclusions

What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?
